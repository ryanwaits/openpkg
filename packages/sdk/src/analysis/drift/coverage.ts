 * Calculate aggregate coverage score from a spec's exports.
 *
 * This is a lightweight function that calculates coverage without
 * requiring full quality evaluation. It handles three cases:
 * 1. Exports with `docs.coverageScore` - uses that value
 * 2. Exports without score but with description - counts as 100%
 * 3. Exports without score and no description - counts as 0%
 *
 * @param spec - The OpenPkg spec to calculate coverage for
 * @returns The aggregate coverage score (0-100)
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { calculateAggregateCoverage } from '@doccov/sdk';
 *
 * const coverage = calculateAggregateCoverage(spec);
 * console.log(`Coverage: ${coverage}%`);
 * ```
